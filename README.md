# Hi!

I'm a fourth-year **Computer Science** and **Sociology** student minoring in **Computer Science** (strange, I know) at **McGill University**!

I am passionate about problem solving difficult challenges at the intersection of software engineering and product by leveraging my leadership skills and experience in programming and design thinking.

Currently, I am:
- Building software for socially impactful organizations through technical and non-technical leadership at the non-profit organization Hack4Impact.
- Developing a platform to visually explore and discover new music.
- Driving innovation and creativity by organizing McGill Engineering's largest hackathon.

And a little bit more about me:
- Favorite theorem(s): Gödel's incompleteness theorems
- Favorite typeface: Helvetica Neue
- Favorite album: Enjoy It While It Lasts by Spector
